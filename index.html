    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Secured Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A secured credit card requires a refundable security deposit, which acts as collateral for the issuer. The deposit usually equals the credit limit, although some issuers offer higher limits after account review.</p>
      <p>From a documentation perspective, secured cards behave exactly like normal credit cards at checkout: they run on the same networks, follow the same authorization steps and use monthly statements.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Deposits and Limits Work</h2>
      <p>Issuer documentation typically highlights:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Deposit amount</strong> – typically \$50–\$500, held as collateral.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit limit</strong> – often equal to the deposit, sometimes reviewed after on-time payments.</li>
        <li><strong>Reporting</strong> – many issuers report to major credit bureaus monthly.</li>
        <li><strong>Refund conditions</strong> – deposit may be returned when upgraded or account is closed in good standing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Secured cards are mainly used by people establishing or rebuilding a credit file, but the mechanics are identical to normal credit cards.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fees, APR and Account Requirements</h2>
      <p>Fee schedules for secured cards often mention:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Annual fees</strong> – not universal, depends on product tier.</li>
        <li><strong>APR</strong> – standard purchase APR applies like any credit card.</li>
        <li><strong>Deposit return rules</strong> – timing and conditions for refund.</li>
        <li><strong>Upgrade criteria</strong> – number of on-time payments, utilisation habits and account reviews.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reading the issuer’s documentation is the only reliable source for upgrade requirements.</p>
