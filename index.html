          Secured cards help build or rebuild credit by using a refundable deposit as collateral. Here’s how deposits, limits, reporting and upgrade paths actually work.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Secured Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>A secured card is a credit card backed by a refundable security deposit. The deposit reduces the lender’s risk, which makes approval easier for people with limited or damaged credit history.</p>
      <p>The card works like a normal credit card — payments are reported to credit bureaus, and responsible use helps build a positive payment history.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Deposit -->
    <section id="deposit" class="section">
      <h2>How the Security Deposit Works</h2>
      <p>The deposit is usually equal to your credit limit (e.g., a $300 deposit gives a $300 limit). It is not used to pay your bill. You must still pay your monthly statement just like with any other credit card.</p>
      <p>Deposits are typically refunded when you close the account in good standing or upgrade to an unsecured card.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Upgrade -->
    <section id="upgrade" class="section">
      <h2>Upgrade Path: Secured → Unsecured</h2>
      <p>Many issuers review secured-card accounts every 6–12 months. If your credit score, payment history and overall profile improve, the card may upgrade automatically to an unsecured card.</p>
      <p>When this happens, your deposit is refunded and your limit may be increased. Some issuers keep the same card number; others replace the card entirely.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Risks / Notes -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risks, Fees and What to Watch Out For</h2>
      <p>Secured cards can include annual fees, monthly maintenance fees or low starting limits. Avoid cards that charge setup fees or require non-refundable charges.</p>
      <p>Make sure the issuer reports to all major credit bureaus — this is essential for rebuilding credit effectively.</p>
